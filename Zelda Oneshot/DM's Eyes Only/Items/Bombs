Regular bombs can be stored in a Bomb Bag (Size 10). Each bomb weighs 10 pounds. Bombs can be thrown 10' with a DC 12 Ranged attack, and are considered Simple weapons.

Bomb flowers are similar, but can only be picked with a DC23 Strength check.
Using the appropriate Gloves reduces this DC by 10.

Bombchus are mouse-shaped bombs sporting blue and yellow colors; they will run straight ahead for 50', and then detonate. Encountering a wall or other static obstacle will cause the bombchu to begin climbing it, as per Spider Climb. Encountering an enemy or destructible will cause it to explode on contact.

Water Bombs are just like bombs, except they can work in water.
