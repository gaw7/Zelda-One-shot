Twilight Princess


DEFENSE------------------------------------
HP / 16
14 (natural armor), CMD (really frickin' high, b/c swarm)
Initiative, +2


OFFENSE------------------------------------
CMB (Bite) = -4; otherwise, (small) -8
Bite: +4 to hit (there's a lot of them), 2d4.
*Getting bitten by a bonefish allows for the school to attempt a grapple check.


BEHAVIOR-----------------------------------
Swarm, Undead(?)

This school of boney, aggressive fish prowls dungeon waterways.
As a fish, they are exclusively aquatic; they cannot live outside of the water. If a Bonefish finds itself outside of the water, then it will flop towards the nearest body of water.

Bonefish are not intelligent (Int < 3), relying purel on instincts, which resemble boars now that I think about it.
