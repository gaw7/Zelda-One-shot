BEHAVIOR-----------------------------------
Shadow Beasts are magically cursed Twili, mind-controlled into obedience towards their master.

Shadow beasts are never alone, as they have a special ability, Sundown Screech.

Stable Stasis: If a shadow beast would be reduced to 0 or fewer hitpoints, it instead goes to -1, and is stabilized.
Sundown Screech: If a shadow beast finds itself as the last standing shadow beast in its group, it can (and will) use it's full action to screech.
  All Shadow beasts within earshot will recover to full health, and stand up.
  (stun the other creatures, for sound effect?)

Light Sensitive.
