Ocarina


DEFENSE------------------------------------
HP / 13
AC = 13, CMD
Initiative = -2
Speed = 5'

Immune to trip.
For basic things is a slime/ooze.
Mindless.


OFFENSE------------------------------------
BAB, CMB
Attack 1
Vore ~ A Like-Like can attempt to Engulf a character as a combat maneuver check, with a CMB bonus = 12.
  On a success, the character is engulfed for 1d3-1 rounds (minimum 1), after which he or she will be spat up.
  For each round a character is inside a Like-Like, it can roll a special Steal/Disarm maneuver check, with a bonus = 11. This
  can be to steal anything, including items being worn or held by the character. On a success, the item remains within the Like-Like
  until it is defeated.


BEHAVIOR-----------------------------------
"Shield-eaters and world leaders have many likes alike."
Like-Likes live in dark, moist places... or so you'd think, because the very first one you meet is in the Fire Temple.
... That's all I've got.
