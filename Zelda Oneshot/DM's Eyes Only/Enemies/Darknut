BEHAVIOR-----------------------------------
Towering in between seven and eight feet tall, Darknuts are Large creatures, taking the appearance of suits of plate armor.
Magical creatuers, vey little is known about these evil beings clad, or perhaps crafted from, tempered steel.

The Darknut will begin play in full armor, in a mode called "Heavy." As the darknut takes more and more damage, the pieces of its outer shell
will break off, revealing the lighter armor beneath. Once at half-health, the Darknut will throw its main sword and shield away, and enter "light" mode.

In heavy mode, the darkneut will be opportunistic and defensive, both sword and shield raised high. However, when it enters Light mode, it will become much faster,
as well as more aggressive, attacking with its sidearm, a "rapier".

The pendulum blade is considered a heavy weapon, in that it requires 14 strength or more to use, and weighs 20 pounds. It is a large weapon.

When a darknut reaches half HP, give it a second place in initiative.
