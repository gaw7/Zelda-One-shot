BEHAVIOR-----------------------------------
Dodongos are usually solitary creatures, only appearing at most in trios, and usually alone. They crawl along their bellies deep within mines and tunnels, and never far from geothermal activity.
Their hide is near-impenetrable, except for a Weak Spot on their tails, which have an AC of 14. If a Dodongo is denied is dexterity, flat-footed, or a character specifies that he/she attack
the tail (which requires being behind the dodongo), then this AC is used, instead. Discovering this requires a Nature check = 15.
