An ancient evil, and the original demon to wage war on humanity. It was by Demise's terror that Hylia secured a portion of humanity in one area, and then raised it above the clouds to become Skyloft.
Demise was sealed several times, but broke the seal each time. The final time he did this, he directly challenged the Hero. He was defeated, however, he then cursed both the Hero, as well as the reincarnation of Hylia, that they three would repeatedly reincarnate, cyclically, so that he could avenge himself.
This is why Link, Zelda, and Ganondorf are in a never-ending fued.
