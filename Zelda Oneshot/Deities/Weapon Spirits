A number of weapons have spirits inhabiting them, and the ability to communicate with their wielders. The most obvious example being Fi, the spirit sealed within the Blade of Evils' Bane, whom aided the Hero of the Skies. Additionally, there is Ghirahim, the spirit within the Blade of Demise, who has the ability to teleport, and whose skin, when materialized, is stronger than armor. But these weapons persist beyond Skyward Sword.

In Twilight Princess, it is revealed that the Gale Boomerang also has a spirit within; while it does not reveal itself or materialize, it does speak to its wielder.

These aren't "deities," per se, but I thought they should be mentioned, regardless.
