For all intents and purposes, the patron goddess of the
Hylians, whom she protected against the evil
forces of Demise. She is shown through statues
in both Skyward Sword and Breath of the Wild
but also, reincarnates every so often as
Princess Zelda, due to Demise's curse. In BotW,
praying at her statues gives the Hero more
health and stamina.
