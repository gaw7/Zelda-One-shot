    An archeological dig has uncovered an ancient tomb!
    The Hero can't come by, as he's gone off to a faraway land, so it has been appointed to you all to go in and clear it out, just in case something nasty has taken up root.
    Wouldn't want anybody getting hurt, after all!~



Everything in these folders, EXCEPT "DM's Eyes Only," is available to view for Player Character Creation.



Additional information:
    -We will be using rupees, instead of cp/sp/gp/pp/ep, because it's easier. 1 rupee = 1 sp = 1/10 gp.
    -This is intended to be at least a little silly, but it can be more serious as needed.
    -Player Character level 10.
    -This is intended to be a dungeon crawl.
