    An archeological dig has uncovered an ancient tomb!
    The hero can't come by, as he's gone off to a faraway land, so it has been appointed to you all to go in and clear it out, just in case something nasty has taken up root.
    Wouldn't want anybody getting hurt, after all!~

This is intended to be a dungeon crawl.
