Sheikah
Various Games
-------------------

Mysterious servants to the Royal Family of Hyrule, Sheikah are cautious and distrusting. Though, sometimes Sheikah depart their way of life, and join the splinter-group
Yiga Clan. They stand at the same heights as regular Hylians, but are also identifiable (when undisguised) by their trademark, bright-red eyes and white hair. Additionally, they tend
to age slower than normal Hylians, and are known for living decades past 100.

Notable Sheikah include Impa*, Impa**, and Impa***.
*Skyward Sword
**Ocarina of Time
***Breath of the Wild

Dex +2. Sheikah are agile, and train from birth to develop flexibility.

  caster level, and Intelligence as casting modifier.
