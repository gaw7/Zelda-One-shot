Hylian
All of them.
-------------------

The native peoples of Hyrule. Even in the face of adversity, they remain hopeful for the most part... though, they are far from immune to tragedy, as the legends tell it.
Hylians stand typically between five and six feet tall, and can have hair of any color (eg: yellow, red, brown, black, purple, etc).

Notable Hylians include Link and Zelda.
