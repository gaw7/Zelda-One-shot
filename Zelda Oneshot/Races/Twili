Twili
Twilight Princess
-------------------

A tribe of magi, exiled to the plane of shadows, magically evolved to their perpetual half-light.

Notable twili include Midna and Zant.


Stats
-------------------
Str +2. Twili are often seen weilding swords (Zant uses three).
Cha +2. Twili magic is secluded to their bloodlines, and dummy thicc.
Wis -2. Magical glass cannons, Twili are susceptible to spells and lies.

Additional Modifications
-------------------
Twi-Sight. Twili can see perfectly in dim light, and 120' in dark, but they are Dazzled in areas of bright light.
Twili can cast Darkness twice per day as a spell-like ability.
Once per day, a Twili can meld with shadows. This allows he/she to become one with the shadow of a particular
person or thing. Detecting a twili in this way reauires a perception check vs the Twili's stealth, with a -13 disadvantage.
