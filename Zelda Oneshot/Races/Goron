Goron
Various
-------------------

A tribe of cheery mountain folk with purple, coal-like eyes and wide smiles. Gorons are friendly and industrious, with an elder-based patriarchy and
seemingly no female members to speak of. Some Gorons go and travel the world, or else set up shop as merchants in various entrepreneurial ventures.
It is not clear whether clothes are needed or not in Goron society.

Notable Gorons include Darunia, Darbus, and Daruk.
